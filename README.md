# Third Iteration on a project
This third iteration was trying to use CPI calls in order to transfers token into another account. It is like a monolithic account abstraction layer with permissionned systems embedded into it. There is some big flaws with this design, but it is the one used with the app.

If you want to use the app with it and deploy a compatible version.

This system was still in the monolithic fashion idea. Because I overthink performance for some practicity (account abstraction + permissionned system) which revealved itsef being a much better solution.
